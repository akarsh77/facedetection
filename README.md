# FACE DETECTION USING HAAR CASCADE CLASSIFIERS

Face Detection using OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) and HaarCascade Classifiers for detecting faces  fromImages, Videos and Webcam.

# Face Detection
"Face detection is a computer technology that determines the locations and sizes of human faces in arbitrary (digital) images. It detects facial features and ignores anything else, such as buildings, trees and bodies. Face detection can be regarded as a more general case of face localization. In face localization, the task is to find the locations and sizes of a known number of faces (usually one)." - wiki - Face detection

# Requirements 
1.	OpenCv version  : 4.2.0
2.	Numpy version : numpy>=1.17.3 
3.	Python version	: 3.8.2
